      <description>Objective Before we begin, I would like to acknowledge that the framework for this analysis was adapted from a blogpost found on the wonderfully interesting R-bloggers website. The objective of this analysis is to use sentiment analysis on different religious texts to visualise the differences/ similarities between them. This concept is of course fraught with a host of issues. Not least of which being detractors who will likely not endeavour to engage in rational debate against the findings of this work.</description>
